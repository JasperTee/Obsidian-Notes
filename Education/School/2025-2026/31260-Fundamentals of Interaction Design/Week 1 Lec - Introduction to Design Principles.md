## 1. What is Interaction Design (IxD)?

- **Definition:** The design of interactions between people and products (apps, websites, mobile phones, game consoles, watches, wearables, etc.).
    
- **Goal:** Make products **useful** and **usable**, helping users achieve their objectives in the best way.
    
- **Quote (Rogers, Sharp & Preece):** _Designing interactive products containing embedded electronics that respond to people’s actions._
    

→ In short: IxD is about **how people use technology** and **how technology responds back**.
## 2. Dimensions of Interaction Design

### 1. **Words (1D)**

- Refers to text, labels, and instructions used in an interface.
    
- Purpose: to communicate actions and information clearly.
    
- If the wording is unclear, users may get confused.
    

**Example:**

- A button labeled **“Submit”** makes it obvious that clicking it will send the form.
    
- A button labeled only **“OK”** can be vague, as the action is not clear.

### 2. **Visual Representations (2D)**

- Includes icons, images, graphics, typography, and colors.
    
- They provide quick visual cues and support the meaning of text.
    

**Example:**

- A **trash bin icon** represents “delete” without needing words.
    
- **Red color** usually signals an error or warning.
    
- **Bold large fonts** for headings vs. **small fonts** for descriptions.
    

---

### 3. **Physical Objects or Spaces (3D)**

- The hardware or physical environment where interaction happens.
    
- Designers must consider shape, size, and placement in real space.
    

**Example:**

- A **smartphone** has a small touchscreen, so buttons must be large enough to tap.
    
- A **VR headset** needs spatial interaction design (movement, hand tracking).
    
- An **airport kiosk** screen is tilted and placed at eye level for easier use.
    

---

### 4. **Time (4D)**

- How the system changes over time, including motion, animations, and responsiveness.
    
- Feedback timing is essential to guide the user.
    

**Example:**

- A **progress bar** when downloading a file shows ongoing activity.
    
- A **loading spinner** signals the system is processing.
    
- **Page transition animations** make the experience smooth and natural.
    

---

### 5. **Behaviour (5D)**

- Includes both:
    
    - **User actions** (tapping, swiping, dragging, speaking).
        
    - **System reactions** (displaying results, vibrating, sending notifications).
        
- This dimension captures the **two-way interaction**.
    

**Example:**

- User **swipes** the screen → the page **scrolls**.
    
- User **clicks “Send”** → system shows **“Message sent”**.
    
- User **says “OK Google”** → system responds with voice feedback.
## 3. Design Principles
### 1. **Visibility**

- Users must see **what actions are possible**.
    
- Clear visibility supports **discoverability** and helps predict outcomes.
    
- Use contrast, size, color, and placement to highlight important elements.
    

**Example:**

- A large blue **“Login”** button at the center of the screen.
    
- A navigation menu placed at the top of a website instead of hidden in layers.
    

---

### 2. **Feedback**

- Tell users **what has happened, what is happening, and what will happen next**.
    
- Feedback must be **immediate and informative**.
    

**Example:**

- Gmail shows “Your message has been sent” after sending an email.
    
- A **progress bar** when downloading a file.
    
- A smartwatch **vibrates** when you reach your daily steps goal.
    

---

### 3. **Constraints**

- Restrict wrong actions to reduce errors.
    
- Help users choose correctly even if they are new.
    

**Example:**

- A battery can only be inserted in one orientation.
    
- Quiz apps: you can’t move to the next question before answering the current one.
    
- Greyed-out buttons when required fields are incomplete.
    

---

### 4. **Consistency**

- Similar actions should look and behave the same.
    
- Makes systems easier to learn and remember.
    

**Example:**

- In MS Office, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint share the same ribbon toolbar.
    
- Shortcuts: **Ctrl+C** is always Copy, **Ctrl+S** is always Save.
    

---

### 5. **Affordances**

- Properties of an object suggest **how it can be used**.
    
- Good affordances let users know what to do just by looking.
    

**Example:**

- A button that looks raised suggests “press me.”
    
- A door handle suggests “pull.”
    
- On a UI, icons with a shadow or border suggest “clickable.”
    

---

### 6. **Signifiers**

- Explicit signals used when affordances are not obvious.
    
- Labels, hints, or instructions that guide user actions.
    

**Example:**

- A door with a label **“Push”** or **“Pull.”**
    
- A button with both an icon and text “Start.”
    
- “Swipe up to unlock” instruction on a smartphone screen.
    

---

### 7. **Mapping**

- The logical relationship between **controls** and **results**.
    
- Helps users understand actions without memorization.
    
- Supported by Gestalt principles (proximity, similarity, grouping).
    

**Example:**

- Media player buttons arranged in sequence: << Rewind – Play – Forward >>.
    
- Stove knobs aligned directly with the burners they control.
    
- Volume control icon (speaker) placed next to the volume slider.
