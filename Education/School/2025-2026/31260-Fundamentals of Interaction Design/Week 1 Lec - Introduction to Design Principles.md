### 1. What is Interaction Design (IxD)?

- **Definition:** The design of interactions between people and products (apps, websites, mobile phones, game consoles, watches, wearables, etc.).
    
- **Goal:** Make products **useful** and **usable**, helping users achieve their objectives in the best way.
    
- **Quote (Rogers, Sharp & Preece):** _Designing interactive products containing embedded electronics that respond to people’s actions._
    

→ In short: IxD is about **how people use technology** and **how technology responds back**.
