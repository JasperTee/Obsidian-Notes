## Affinity Diagramming
### 1. Definition

- **Affinity Diagramming** is a method for **organizing qualitative data** (from interviews, observations, surveys) into meaningful clusters.
    
- The goal: turn raw, scattered data into **themes and patterns** that highlight **problems** and **design opportunities**.

### 2. Why use Affinity Diagramming?

- After research, you usually have a **large amount of messy data**: user quotes, observations, emotions, behaviors.
    
- On its own, this data is hard to process.
    
- Affinity Diagramming helps to:
    
    1. Get an overview of all research findings.
        
    2. Recognize **repeated patterns**.
        
    3. Identify **main themes**.
        
    4. Build the foundation for **Personas** and **Problem Statements**.

### 3. Steps in Affinity Diagramming

#### Step 1: Extract findings (individually)

- Each team member reviews their research notes.
    
- Write down **keywords, short sentences, or direct quotes** on post-it notes (physical or digital).
    
- Example: _“I often get distracted when working from home.”_
    

#### Step 2: Display findings (as a group)

- Collect all notes on a shared wall or digital board (Miro, FigJam, Mural).
    
- Place them randomly at first to see the bigger picture.
    

#### Step 3: Sort findings into groups (as a group)

- Look for **similarities or relationships** between notes.
    
- Cluster related notes into groups (themes).
    
- You can **duplicate notes** if they belong in more than one group.
    
- Keep “loner” notes in a separate cluster.
    

#### Step 4: Create headers for groups (as a group)

- Write a **header** (short title) for each cluster that summarizes its essence.
    
- Example: if several notes mention “stress, lack of focus, fatigue,” the header could be **“Mental Wellbeing Challenges.”**
    

#### Step 5: Review and refine

- Check if the clusters make sense.
    
- Rearrange notes or try different categorizations.
    
- Split, merge, or rename groups as needed.

### 4. Four Basic Rules

1. **Go for quantity** – write down as many findings as possible.
    
2. **Encourage unusual ideas** – don’t ignore odd or unique findings.
    
3. **Build on others’ ideas** – expand clusters collaboratively.
    
4. **Withhold judgment** – there are no “bad” ideas during this process.

### 5. Example

Suppose your topic is **“wellbeing at home.”**

- **Findings (notes):**
    
    - “I feel lonely because I rarely see my friends.”
        
    - “I get stressed when working from home.”
        
    - “I exercise to stay healthy.”
        
    - “I listen to music to relax.”
        
- **Groups (themes):**
    
    - **Social wellbeing** → “Lonely, no friends around.”
        
    - **Mental wellbeing** → “Stress at home.”
        
    - **Physical wellbeing** → “Exercise to stay healthy.”
        
    - **Emotional wellbeing** → “Music helps me relax.”
        
- **Headers:** Social, Mental, Physical, Emotional.

### 6. Application in Design

The results of Affinity Diagramming are used for:

1. **Personas** – clusters provide the basis for fictional user characters.
    
2. **Problem Statements** – key issues are summarized into clear statements.
    
3. **Design Pitch** – your group can brainstorm design solutions addressing these themes.
---
## Personas 
### 1. Definition

- A **Persona** is a **fictional but research-based character** that represents a typical group of users.
    
- It is **not one real person**, but a **composite** built from patterns across multiple interviewees or observations.
    
- Purpose: to help the design team **understand, empathize with, and remember users** throughout the design process.
    

---

### 2. Why use Personas?

- You cannot involve real users all the time. A persona serves as a **stand-in** to keep user needs present.
    
- **Roles of personas:**
    
    1. Keep the design team focused on user goals and needs.
        
    2. Build **empathy** for users.
        
    3. Provide a common language when communicating with stakeholders (e.g., “Michael, our persona, struggles to concentrate at home” instead of a vague “users struggle”).
        
    4. Guide and justify design decisions, helping to prioritize features.
        

---

### 3. Characteristics of Personas

- **Synthesized from multiple people**, not just one interview.
    
- **Fictional but realistic**: includes name, age, occupation, hobbies, goals.
    
- Must be **specific and research-based**, not stereotypes or vague generalizations.
    
- **Problem-focused**: should always include a user **problem statement or a quote** in the user’s voice.

### 4. What to include (as required for AT3)

1. **Profile information**: age, gender, marital status, children, occupation, expertise.
    
2. **User problem**: either a direct quote or a problem statement.
    
3. **Short bio** or **“day in the life.”**
    
4. **Goals and needs**, especially related to **wellbeing at home**.
    
5. **Images**: activities, tools, technologies, lifestyle elements (can be AI-generated).
    
6. **Delights**: joys, motivations, hopes, desires.
    
7. **Pains**: frustrations, fears, obstacles.
    
8. **Character**: personality traits and behaviors.
    
9. **Habits**: routines, hobbies, regular activities.
    
10. **Life at home**: description of the home environment.
    
11. **Technology use**: devices, level of literacy, preferences.

### 6. Best Practices

- **Do not use real photos of interviewees** → use stock photos or AI-generated images.
    
- Avoid **celebrity photos, cartoons, or icons** → personas must feel human and realistic.
    
- Do not create an “average user” → focus on meaningful **patterns** found in your data.
    
- You may need **multiple personas** if your problem space has different types of users.
