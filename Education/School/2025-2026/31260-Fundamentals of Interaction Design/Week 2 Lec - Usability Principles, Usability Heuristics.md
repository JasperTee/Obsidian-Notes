## 1. What is Usability?

### Definition

- Usability is **a measure** of how well a specific user, in a specific context, can use a product/design to achieve a defined goal **effectively, efficiently, and satisfactorily**.
    
- In other words:
    
    - It checks if people can actually use the product.
        
    - It considers both **task success** (did they finish the task?) and **experience quality** (was it easy and pleasant?).

### Position in UX Design

Usability is part of **User Experience (UX)** and sits **between utility and desirability**:

1. **Utility** – Is the product useful?
    
    - Can it do the job users need?
        
    - Example: A calculator app can calculate equations.
        
2. **Usability** – Is the product easy and enjoyable to use?
    
    - Does it make the process smooth?
        
    - Example: A calculator with a clean layout and large buttons.
        
3. **Desirability** – Is the product attractive and appealing?
    
    - Does the design and style make people _want_ to use it?
        
    - Example: A calculator with a modern design and animations.

### Useful vs. Usable

- **Useful** = Practical, helps to achieve the goal effectively.
    
- **Usable** = Pleasurable, the process of achieving the goal is enjoyable.
    

Example:

- A text editor that has all features but is hard to navigate → useful but **not usable**.
    
- A simple note-taking app that is easy and pleasant to use → less powerful but **highly usable**.

### Measuring Usability

- Usability is not tested only at the end but **throughout the development process**:
    
    - **Wireframes** (early sketches of the interface)
        
    - **Prototypes** (interactive mock-ups)
        
    - **Final product**
        
- This ensures usability problems are found early, before the product is released.
