## 1. What is Usability?

### Definition

- Usability is **a measure** of how well a specific user, in a specific context, can use a product/design to achieve a defined goal **effectively, efficiently, and satisfactorily**.
    
- In other words:
    
    - It checks if people can actually use the product.
        
    - It considers both **task success** (did they finish the task?) and **experience quality** (was it easy and pleasant?).

### Position in UX Design

Usability is part of **User Experience (UX)** and sits **between utility and desirability**:

1. **Utility** – Is the product useful?
    
    - Can it do the job users need?
        
    - Example: A calculator app can calculate equations.
        
2. **Usability** – Is the product easy and enjoyable to use?
    
    - Does it make the process smooth?
        
    - Example: A calculator with a clean layout and large buttons.
        
3. **Desirability** – Is the product attractive and appealing?
    
    - Does the design and style make people _want_ to use it?
        
    - Example: A calculator with a modern design and animations.

### Useful vs. Usable

- **Useful** = Practical, helps to achieve the goal effectively.
    
- **Usable** = Pleasurable, the process of achieving the goal is enjoyable.
    

Example:

- A text editor that has all features but is hard to navigate → useful but **not usable**.
    
- A simple note-taking app that is easy and pleasant to use → less powerful but **highly usable**.

### Measuring Usability

- Usability is not tested only at the end but **throughout the development process**:
    
    - **Wireframes** (early sketches of the interface)
        
    - **Prototypes** (interactive mock-ups)
        
    - **Final product**
        
- This ensures usability problems are found early, before the product is released.
## 2. The 5 Es of Usability

These are five main factors used to measure **usability** of a product or system.

---

### 1. **Effective**

- **Definition:** How completely and accurately users can achieve their goals.
    
- Meaning: Does the system allow users to accomplish what they want correctly?
    
- **Example:**
    
    - Google Maps gives correct directions to the destination → effective.
        
    - If the app shows the wrong location → not effective.
        

---

### 2. **Efficient**

- **Definition:** How quickly and with minimal resources a task can be completed.
    
- Meaning: Not just finishing the task, but finishing it in the best way.
    
- **Example:**
    
    - Using keyboard shortcuts like **Ctrl+C / Ctrl+V** is faster than using the mouse.
        
    - Amazon’s “1-click checkout” speeds up online purchases → efficient.
        

---

### 3. **Engaging**

- **Definition:** How well the interface draws users in, making the experience pleasant and satisfying.
    
- Meaning: Is it enjoyable and motivating to use?
    
- **Example:**
    
    - Duolingo makes learning fun with animations and rewards → engaging.
        
    - A plain e-learning site with only long text → less engaging.
        

---

### 4. **Error Tolerant**

- **Definition:** How well the system prevents errors, or helps users recover when errors occur.
    
- Meaning: Users should not easily make mistakes, and if they do, they can fix them quickly.
    
- **Example:**
    
    - Gmail shows a warning: “You forgot the subject line, send anyway?” → prevents error.
        
    - Microsoft Word allows **Undo/Redo** to fix mistakes.
        

---

### 5. **Easy to Learn**

- **Definition:** How quickly new users can learn to use the system, and how well they can continue to use it over time.
    
- Meaning: Users should not need heavy training or manuals.
    
- **Example:**
    
    - Instagram: open the app, and it’s immediately clear how to post a photo → easy to learn.
        
    - Complex software like AutoCAD requires long training before being usable → not easy to learn.
