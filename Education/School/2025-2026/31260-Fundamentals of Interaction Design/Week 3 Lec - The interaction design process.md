## 1. What is Design?

### Definition

Design is a **goal-directed problem-solving activity**. It means:

- You **simulate** (sketch, model, prototype) what you want to create **before** making it.
    
- You can repeat this simulation many times until you are confident in the final result.  
    → Design is about **planning and testing ideas** to reach the best outcome.
    

---

### What design tries to achieve

Design is a **construction** that:

- Aims to **change the world** from what it currently is.
    
- Introduces **new functions** or new ways of doing old things.
    
- Leads to a **better life** (though sometimes with side effects).
    
- Must be **useful**.
    
- Must evoke a **positive response** from users.
    
- Often combines **science and art**.
    

A simple summary:  
**Design is a proposal to change an existing situation into a preferred situation.**

---

### Problem space vs. solution space

Design moves between two spaces:

- **Problem space**: current situation, user problems, desires, and expectations.
    
- **Solution space**: possible designs that can solve problems and satisfy needs.
    

Examples from lecture:

- Problem solved → moving from “hard to carry music” to “portable music” (Sony Walkman).
    
- Desire satisfied → people wanting music anywhere, anytime.
    
- Expectation fulfilled → design meets hidden or future expectations (like iPod).
    

---

### Design as both process and artefacts

Design is:

1. **A process over time**: going through steps like research, ideation, prototyping, testing.
    
2. **Artefacts produced along the way**:
    
    - Persona
        
    - Problem scenario
        
    - Future use scenario
        
    - Storyboard
        
    - Prototype
        
    - Usability report
        
    - Design-in-action video
        

---

### Importance of design

- Design brings something **new and useful** that did not exist before.
    
- Famous quote (Denys Lasdun, 1965):  
    _“Our job is to give the client not what he wants, but what he never dreamed he wanted; and when he gets it, he recognizes it as something he wanted all the time.”_
    
- Examples: Sony Walkman, Apple iPod, Google Search evolution, shopping evolution (catalog → online → virtual mirror).
## 2. What is Interaction Design?

### Definition

**Interaction Design (IxD)** is a **user-focused design discipline**.  
It deals with the **design of interactive digital products, environments, systems, and services**.

- The focus is not only on **form** (how something looks),
    
- but also on **human needs** and the **behaviours that govern how people use and respond** to technology.
    

(Source: Cooper et al., _About Face: The Essentials of Interaction Design_, 2014)

---

### Purpose of Interaction Design

- **Human-centered**: ensures that every design decision relates to real people and their needs.
    
- **Behaviour-oriented**: emphasizes **what people do**, **how they act**, and **how the system responds**.
    
- **Experience-focused**: aims to create products that are not only functional but also **useful, usable, and satisfying**.
    

---

### Examples from the lecture

1. **Google Search**
    
    - 1998: simple, text-heavy interface.
        
    - 2004 → 2020: streamlined, visually clean, more intuitive.  
        → IxD shaped how users **search for and interact with information**.
        
2. **Music consumption**
    
    - Sony Walkman (1984) → Apple iPod (2001): changed how people **carried and interacted with music**.
        
    - From physical tapes → digital storage, from limited songs → thousands of songs in your pocket.
        
3. **Shopping evolution**
    
    - Mail-order catalogues (before 1990s).
        
    - Online shopping (Amazon 1995).
        
    - Virtual mirror technology (Uniqlo 2012).  
        → IxD transformed **how users experience the act of shopping**, from browsing to trying on virtually.
        

---

### Key characteristics of Interaction Design

- **User-focused**: always considers the end-user.
    
- **Behavioural focus**: designs the _actions_ and _responses_ between humans and systems.
    
- **Digital orientation**: primarily applied in the context of digital technology (apps, websites, IoT devices, smart systems).
    
- **Iterative nature**: requires continuous prototyping, testing, and refinement.
    

---

### Easy way to see the difference

- **Design in general**: creating a solution that changes the world from its existing state to a preferred one.
    
- **Interaction Design**: focusing specifically on **how humans interact with that solution**, especially in digital contexts.
    

#### Simple examples

- A chair itself is **design**; the way it folds, adjusts height, or how comfortable it feels to sit in → that’s **interaction design**.
    
- A banking app’s **color scheme and logo** are design elements, but whether users can **transfer money easily in three taps without confusion** is an **interaction design problem**.
## 3. The Interaction Design Process

### Definition

The **Interaction Design (IxD) process** is the structured way designers move from an **existing situation** (problem space) to a **preferred situation** (solution space).  
It’s not a straight line — it’s **progressive but not linear**, and it relies heavily on **iteration** (repeating steps to refine ideas).

(Source: Preece et al., _Interaction Design: Beyond Human-Computer Interaction_, 2015)

---

### The Five Core Stages

The process is often described in **five stages** (similar to design thinking):

#### 1. Understand

- **Goal**: Learn about the people, the context, and the problems you are designing for.
    
- **Activities**:
    
    - User research (interviews, surveys, observations, role-playing).
        
    - Literature research (reviewing academic papers or prior reports).
        
- **Outcome**: A rich picture of the **problem space** — what users do, think, feel, and need.
    
- **Example**: Observing how students currently use an online learning platform to identify frustrations.
    

---

#### 2. Define

- **Goal**: Frame a **clear and focused problem statement** that can guide design.
    
- **Activities**:
    
    - Organise research findings into categories or themes.
        
    - Common method: **Affinity Diagramming** — clustering sticky notes of user insights into meaningful groups.
        
- **Outcome**: A defined problem or set of challenges you want to solve.
    
- **Example**: “Students cannot easily track their deadlines in the current platform.”
    

---

#### 3. Ideate

- **Goal**: Generate a wide range of possible solutions, not just one.
    
- **Mindset**: Go for **quantity over quality** at this stage.
    
- **Methods**:
    
    - Brainstorming (free idea generation).
        
    - Bodystorming (acting out scenarios).
        
    - Six Thinking Hats (exploring multiple perspectives).
        
    - Extreme Characters (imagining how unusual users might approach the product).
        
    - Mind maps (connecting and expanding ideas visually).
        
- **Outcome**: A pool of creative ideas that can be combined, refined, or selected for prototyping.
    
- **Example**: For deadline tracking → ideas like a visual calendar, reminder notifications, or AI-based study assistant.
    

---

#### 4. Prototype

- **Goal**: Turn abstract ideas into **tangible representations** so they can be discussed and tested.
    
- **Levels of fidelity**:
    
    - Low-fidelity: sketches on paper, storyboards, cardboard mockups.
        
    - High-fidelity: digital mockups, interactive wireframes, working software demos.
        
- **Purpose**:
    
    - Test concepts early, before investing resources.
        
    - Encourage discussion between designers, users, and stakeholders.
        
- **Example**: Drawing a paper mockup of a study calendar app with sticky notes for assignments.
    

---

#### 5. Test

- **Goal**: Validate ideas and prototypes by gathering feedback.
    
- **Methods**:
    
    - Usability testing (observing real users trying the prototype).
        
    - Heuristic evaluation (experts reviewing against usability principles).
        
- **Purpose**: Check if the design is **useful**, **usable**, and **satisfying**.
    
- **Outcome**: Identify problems, refine the design, and possibly loop back to earlier stages.
    
- **Example**: Giving students the prototype calendar app and asking them to find all their upcoming deadlines. If they struggle, refine and test again.
        

---

### Key Principles of the Process

- **Iterative, not linear**: You don’t just finish one stage and move on forever. Instead, you cycle back, refine, and improve.
    
    - Example: after testing, you might go back to ideation or even redefine the problem.
        
- **Intertwined activities**: Ideating, prototyping, and testing often happen together in overlapping cycles.
    
- **Progressive refinement**: Each cycle brings you closer to a good design solution.
    

---

### Example in real life

Imagine designing a **mobile food delivery app**:

- **Understand**: Interview students about how they order food, note pain points (e.g., “menus are confusing”).
    
- **Define**: The main problem — “Users can’t quickly find healthy meal options under 15 minutes.”
    
- **Ideate**: Brainstorm solutions like filters, nutrition tags, or a “quick picks” feature.
    
- **Prototype**: Sketch app screens with a “15-min healthy” button.
    
- **Test**: Ask students to try the prototype and see if they can order faster.
    
- Then **iterate** — improve based on their feedback.
    

---

### Key takeaway

The Interaction Design Process is about:

- Starting with **understanding people and problems**.
    
- Defining a **clear design focus**.
    
- Exploring many possible solutions (**ideation**).
    
- Making them tangible (**prototyping**).
    
- Validating with users and refining through **testing**.
    

It’s a **cyclical journey**, not a straight line. The goal is to gradually move from the **problem space** to the **solution space**through user-centered, iterative design.
## 4. Human-Centred Design (HCD)

### Definition

Human-Centred Design (also called **User-Centred Design**) is an approach where the **needs, goals, and issues of people are placed at the center of the design process**.

- It is a **two-way approach**: designers learn from users, and users are actively involved in shaping the design.
    
- The process emphasizes **early testing**, **continuous evaluation**, and **iterative design** with real users.
    
- Outcome: designs that are more **relevant, acceptable, and successful** because they directly reflect user input.
    

---

### Principles of HCD

1. **Focus on users throughout** the design and development process.
    
2. **Active user involvement** in evaluation and feedback.
    
3. **Early and continuous testing** of ideas and prototypes.
    
4. **Iterative cycles** — design is refined repeatedly based on user feedback.
    
5. **Balance between people, tasks, and technology** to ensure usability and satisfaction.
    

---

### Divergent vs. Convergent Thinking

HCD involves two types of thinking:

- **Divergent thinking**: exploring many possible ideas or directions (open-ended, creative).
    
- **Convergent thinking**: narrowing down, refining, and selecting the most promising ideas.
    

This cycle ensures innovation while also moving toward practical solutions.

---

### Why involve users?

Your lecture highlighted three main reasons:

1. **Expectation management**
    
    - Set realistic expectations → fewer surprises or disappointments.
        
    - Provide timely training → help users adapt to the new system.
        
2. **Encourage ownership**
    
    - When users participate, they become **stakeholders**.
        
    - They are more forgiving of small issues.
        
    - They are more likely to adopt the system and support its success.
        
3. **Increase acceptance and success**
    
    - Designs that reflect users’ needs have higher chances of being accepted in real-world use.
        

---

### Examples

- **Hospital redesign using role play**: Designers wore “third age suits” simulating reduced mobility, poor vision, and limited tactile sensitivity. This helped them **empathize with elderly users** and redesign the hospital more effectively.
    
- **Software interfaces**: Testing early prototypes with real users avoids later frustration and ensures the system feels natural.
## Design Thinking

### Definition

**Design Thinking** is an **iterative process** where we try to **understand users and their problems**, **challenge assumptions**, and **redefine problems** to uncover creative strategies and solutions that are not obvious at first sight.

- It integrates:
    
    - **People’s needs**
        
    - **Technological possibilities**
        
    - **Business requirements**
        
- It is a **deeply human process**: it relies on empathy, intuition, recognizing patterns, abductive reasoning (best guesses with incomplete data), and expressing ideas beyond words (sketches, models, prototypes).
    

---

### Key Characteristics

1. **Iteration** – solutions are refined through multiple cycles.
    
2. **Empathy** – placing yourself in the users’ shoes to understand their feelings, needs, and motivations.
    
3. **Active engagement** – designers work _with_ users, not just observe them.
    
4. **Co-construction** – problem and solution spaces evolve together, often with user participation.
    
5. **Divergent & Convergent thinking** – first open up to many possibilities (divergent), then narrow down to the most promising ones (convergent).
    
6. **Abductive reasoning** – making the best possible inferences when knowledge is incomplete.
    

---

### Benefits of Design Thinking

- Helps you **empathize** with users more effectively.
    
- Encourages **redefining problems** rather than assuming they are fixed.
    
- Promotes **creativity** by generating many ideas before narrowing down.
    
- Makes the problem space **tangible and actionable** through sketches, role-play, and prototypes.
    
- Ensures solutions are **tested and refined** through repeated cycles.
    

---

### The Five Stages (Stanford d.school Model)

#### 1. Empathise

- **Goal**: Gain a deep understanding of users, their context, and their problems.
    
- **Methods**:
    
    - **User research**: interviews, surveys, observation, shadowing users in their environment.
        
    - **Role playing**: simulate being in the user’s position.
        
    - **Literature research**: review existing studies to understand the domain.
        
- **Focus**: Discover what users **feel, think, need, and do**.
    
- **Outcome**: Insights that reveal hidden pain points and unmet needs.
    
- **Example**: Watching how students use a learning management system to see where they struggle, rather than just asking them.
    

---

#### 2. Define

- **Goal**: Frame the main problem clearly and meaningfully.
    
- **Activities**:
    
    - Organize research data (e.g., with **affinity diagramming**).
        
    - Extract key insights and translate them into a **problem statement**.
        
- **Outcome**: A clear design challenge that the team can focus on.
    
- **Example problem statement**: “Students need a simple way to track deadlines because current tools overwhelm them with too much information.”
    

---

#### 3. Ideate

- **Goal**: Generate as many creative solutions as possible.
    
- **Mindset**: Focus on **quantity over quality** at this stage — “no idea is too crazy.”
    
- **Techniques**:
    
    - Brainstorming
        
    - Mind mapping
        
    - Bodystorming (acting out scenarios)
        
    - Six Thinking Hats (exploring multiple perspectives)
        
    - Extreme characters (imagine very unusual users to push creativity)
        
- **Outcome**: A large pool of ideas, which can later be refined or combined.
    
- **Example**: For the student deadline problem, ideas might include:
    
    - Color-coded deadline calendar
        
    - “15-minute prep” reminders
        
    - AI assistant suggesting study blocks
        

---

#### 4. Prototype

- **Goal**: Make ideas tangible so they can be tested and discussed.
    
- **Forms of prototypes**:
    
    - **Low-fidelity**: sketches, paper models, storyboards (fast, cheap, rough).
        
    - **High-fidelity**: digital mockups, interactive wireframes, partially working apps (more realistic).
        
- **Purpose**:
    
    - Explore whether ideas work in practice.
        
    - Help users and stakeholders give more concrete feedback.
        
- **Example**: Sketch a simple mobile app calendar on paper to simulate how students would interact with it.
    

---

#### 5. Test

- **Goal**: Validate ideas and refine designs based on real feedback.
    
- **Methods**:
    
    - Usability testing (observe users trying the prototype).
        
    - Expert evaluation (heuristic analysis by specialists).
        
- **Outcome**:
    
    - Learn what works, what doesn’t, and why.
        
    - Discover new insights that may lead back to earlier stages.
        
- **Example**: Ask students to use the prototype to find their next deadline. If they struggle, refine the prototype and test again.
---

### Example

Designing a **student productivity app**:

- **Empathise**: Interview students → find that they struggle with tracking deadlines.
    
- **Define**: Problem statement = “Students need an easy way to track and manage assignment deadlines.”
    
- **Ideate**: Ideas = smart calendar, reminder notifications, AI tutor, group planning board.
    
- **Prototype**: Create a paper sketch of a calendar app with color-coded deadlines.
    
- **Test**: Ask students to use the prototype → refine design based on their feedback.
    

---

### Key Takeaways

- **Design Thinking is human-centered, creative, and iterative.**
    
- It moves through **five stages**: Empathise → Define → Ideate → Prototype → Test.
    
- It is **non-linear**: designers may jump back and forth between stages as needed.
    
- Its strength is in **blending creativity with structured problem-solving**, ensuring solutions are desirable, feasible, and viable.
## User Research (Quantitative & Qualitative)

### Why User Research?

In **Human-Centred Design (HCD)** and **Design Thinking**, research is crucial because it helps us **understand real users**— their behaviours, motivations, needs, and contexts. Without research, designs risk being based only on assumptions.

---

### Two Main Approaches

#### 1. Quantitative Research (Quant.)

- **Focus**: the **WHAT** (and WHEN).
    
- **Goal**: Identify **patterns of behaviour** and measure them numerically.
    
- **Methods**:
    
    - User logs (e.g., click tracking, heatmaps).
        
    - Questionnaires / surveys with closed-ended questions.
        
    - Text mining (extracting trends from large datasets).
        
- **Typical questions**:
    
    - How many users clicked this button?
        
    - What percentage of users completed sign-up successfully?
        
    - How many times did users make errors?
        
    - How satisfied are users on a scale of 1–5?
        
- **Value**:
    
    - Tells us **what is happening**.
        
    - Provides **statistical evidence** (e.g., “70% of users drop off at checkout”).
        
- **Limitation**:
    
    - Does not explain **why** the behaviour is happening.
        

---

#### 2. Qualitative Research (Qual.)

- **Focus**: the **WHY** (and HOW).
    
- **Goal**: Explore **motivation, feelings, experiences, and reasoning** behind behaviour.
    
- **Methods**:
    
    - Interviews (structured or semi-structured).
        
    - Focus groups / workshops.
        
    - User diaries.
        
    - Photos, videos, ethnographic studies.
        
    - Role playing and contextual inquiry.
        
- **Typical questions**:
    
    - Why did users ignore the call-to-action?
        
    - What frustrations did they face?
        
    - How do they feel about the product experience?
        
- **Value**:
    
    - Provides **rich, in-depth insights** into user experience.
        
    - Explains **why something happens**.
        
- **Limitation**:
    
    - Usually based on **smaller samples**; results are not statistically generalizable.
        

---

### Quant vs Qual in Summary

|Aspect|Quantitative|Qualitative|
|---|---|---|
|Focus|**What** is happening, **when**|**Why** it’s happening, **how**|
|Data type|Numbers, statistics|Words, stories, observations|
|Sample size|Large|Small|
|Value|General patterns, measurable|Deeper insights, motivations|
|Example method|Click tracking, surveys|Interviews, role play, workshops|

---

### How They Work Together

- **Quantitative research** gives the **big picture** (e.g., “40% of users abandon shopping carts”).
    
- **Qualitative research** explains the **reasons** (e.g., “users felt checkout forms were too long and confusing”).
    
- Best practice in design: **combine both approaches** to get a holistic view.
    

---

### Example

Imagine designing an **online food delivery app**:

- **Quantitative**: Data shows 35% of users quit before payment.
    
- **Qualitative**: Interviews reveal that users are frustrated because the app requires creating an account before checkout.  
    → Combining both insights: solution could be a **“Guest Checkout” option**.
