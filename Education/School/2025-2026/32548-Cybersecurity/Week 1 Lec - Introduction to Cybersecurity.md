### 1. **What is Cybersecurity?**

Cybersecurity is all about **protecting information** and systems (like computers, networks, phones, websites) from being attacked, stolen, or damaged by bad actors (hackers). It keeps your personal data, business info, and government systems **safe and private**.

### 2. **Why is Cybersecurity important?**

- **Cybercrime is rising** – expected to cost the world $10.5 trillion by 2025.
    
- Even big companies don’t feel confident in their protection.
    
- Attacks like **ransomware** (e.g. WannaCry) have shut down hospitals, power grids, and major firms.

###  3. **Goals of Cybersecurity:**

These are called the **CIA Triad** (plus a few more):

|Goal|Meaning (in simple terms)|
|---|---|
|**Confidentiality**|Keep data secret — only the right people can see it|
|**Integrity**|Keep data accurate — no unauthorised changes|
|**Availability**|Keep systems working — authorised people get access fast|
|**Authenticity**|Verify identity — users are who they claim to be|
|**Accountability**|Track user actions — no one can deny what they did|
