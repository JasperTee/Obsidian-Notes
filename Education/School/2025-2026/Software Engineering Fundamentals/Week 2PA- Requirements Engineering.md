### What is Requirements Engineering?
Requirements Engineering is the process of identifying, analysing, documenting, and managing software requirements.
**Role:**
- Foundation of software development.
- Ensures the product meets needs and quality standards.
- Reduces the risk of failure, cost overruns, and delays.
### Types of Requirements
#### 1. Functional Requirements

- **Definition**: Describe the **functions and tasks** the software must perform.
    
- **Question answered**: _What will the software do?_
    
- **Characteristics**:
    
    - Directly related to the behaviour of the system.
        
    - Often expressed in **use cases**, **user stories**, or business process descriptions.
        
- **Examples**:
    
    1. Allow users to log in with email/password.
        
    2. Calculate order totals and apply discount codes.
        
    3. Generate monthly sales reports.

#### 2. Non-functional Requirements

- **Definition**: Describe the **quality attributes** and **constraints** the system must meet.
    
- **Question answered**: _How well will the system perform?_ or _Under what conditions?_
    
- **Common categories**:
    
    - **Performance**: Response time < 2 seconds.
        
    - **Reliability**: System uptime of 99.9%.
        
    - **Security**: Data encrypted using AES-256.
        
    - **Usability**: New users can complete main tasks within 5 minutes.
        
    - **Maintainability**: Code follows Google Java Style Guide.
        
    - **Scalability**: Support growth from 1,000 to 10,000 concurrent users.

#### 3. User Requirements

- **Definition**: Needs, expectations, and priorities of **end-users or stakeholders**.
    
- **Goal**: Ensure the product matches the desired user experience.
    
- **Examples**:
    
    - The app must be easy to use on mobile devices.
        
    - Dark mode option for user comfort.

#### 4. System Requirements

- **Definition**: Technical requirements for the software to operate effectively.
    
- **Examples**:
    
    - Server must run on Ubuntu 22.04.
        
    - Minimum 8GB RAM.

- **Examples**:
    
    - Must comply with PCI-DSS standards for credit card processing.
